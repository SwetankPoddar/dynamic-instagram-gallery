# Dynamic Instagram Gallery

This is a jQuery script styled with Google's materialize to dynamically create Instagram galleries. 

It doesn't require any type of authentication, it scrapes data from Instagram's website. Because of this, it currently **ONLY** supports public accounts. 

TODO:
* Add a "random account" button
* Notch up the UI (?)
